    "STEP INTO A UNIVERSE OF DARING ADVENTURE, THRILLING POWER, AND MULTIPLE LONDONS.\r<br/>\r<br/>Kell is one of the last travelers--magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel universes connected by one magic city.\r<br/>\r<br/>There's Grey London, dirty and boring, without any magic, and with one mad king--George III. Red London, where life and magic are revered--and where Kell was raised alongside Rhy Maresh, the roguish heir to a flourishing empire. White London--a place where people fight to control magic and the magic fights back, draining the city to its very bones. And once upon a time, there was Black London. But no one speaks of that now.\r<br/>\r<br/>Officially, Kell is the Red Traveler, ambassador of the Maresh Empire, carrying the monthly correspondences between the royals of each London. Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.\r<br/>\r<br/>Fleeing into Grey London, Kell runs into Delilah Bard, a cutpurse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit  her to another world for a proper adventure.\r<br/>\r<br/>Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.\r<br/>\r<br/>This description comes from the publisher. *A Darker Shade of Magic* is the first book of the Shades of Magic trilogy.",
